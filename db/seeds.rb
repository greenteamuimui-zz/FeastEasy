But it doesn't end there, Andre is always experimenting with his friendly neighbors' cuisine, be it freshly baked Danishes from (where else, Denmark) to Finnish Ruisleipä, rye bread, to Swedish meatballs. And no, those are not the kind you find at Ikea. Andre's love of cooking and nostalgic desire to for home food will make you feel like you transported to Scandinavia. Minus the harsh winter.

My husband and I would be delighted to welcome you to our home. You never know what I will cook up next. It could be spicy tofu kimchi soup, or maybe delicious Korean fried chicken (warning: you won't ever go back to KFC after trying out my spicy and juicy chicken). If you don't know the difference between Japanese and Korean Ramen, given me a chance and I will show you which one is the best. I may be a little biased on that but you be the judge.

P.S. My husband is Russian, so as a bonus you may experience some traditional Russian dumplings side by side with the beef bulgogi. But that depends on his mood lol

I have 3 rice cookers that I like to experiment with and I try different ingredients every time so feel free to come multiple times - it is very likely you will have different experiences every single time. I invite my guests to come early to help me cook. I truly believe that cooking sushi is a great way to learn new skills that you can use every day. Join me. You host, Johny.")
